Online Payment Fraud Detection
Although researchers (Pizzol et al., 2018; Karoubi et al., 2016; Fabris, 2019; Yang et al., 2015) have used different terms such as digital payment, electronic money, cashless payment, which all means online payment and can be defined as payments made using electronic device and channels with the aid of the internet. Over the years, studies (Zhang et al., 2018; Laukkanen and Kiviniemi, 2010; Rehncrona 2018) have focused largely on the benefits related to banking or payment such as reduced transport cost, service delivery regardless time frame, reduced human resources etc. However, fraudulent transactions are increasing now a day in large amounts which have caused great losses for some banks and their fin-tech consultants. 
In line with the Theory of Perceive Risk (TPR), which states that risks entails benefits this means; there is a likelihood for loss in the pursuit of a desired outcome when using an online payment service. To this backdrop, this study, employed the use of python to explore an Online Payment Fraud Detection Dataset using models to predict fraud and fraud less transactions with regards the type of transaction, amount, and changes in the account balance of the customer (sender and recipient). The outcome from this would help BB Plc make informed decision on appropriate risk control measures whilst providing optimum service delivery to online customers. 

Step 1. Lunch the jupyter notebook for python
Step 2. Import necessary python libraries pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, ploty.express etc. to enable univariate and bivariate analysis of data.
Step 3. Read the csv dataset on python
Step 4. Check the dataset content and info
Step 5. Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Checking correlations
•	Transforming categorical variables 
Step 6. Splitting, training and testing learning models 
While carrying out analysis, I had challenges in fitting the models accurately.
